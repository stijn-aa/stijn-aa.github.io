# Best practices
<s>[-] Used XMLHttpRequest; to get the flight information from the api.</s>

[-] Used promise to get the flight information from the api.

[-] Using 'Get date' I modified the request header to get the flight that are currently taking off.

[-] Using forEach I created a block for each departing flight.

[-] Used object literals to request and render different pages.

[-] added Router to detail pages of flights
